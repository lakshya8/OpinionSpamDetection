<p style="text-align:justify;">
India has an internet users base of about 475 million as of July 2019, about 40% of the population. 
This number is expected to be 627 million by the end of 2019. Despite being the second-largest 
userbase in world, the penetration of e-commerce  is low compared to markets like the United States or France , 
but is growing, adding around 6 million new entrants every month. The industry consensus is that growth is at an inflection point.
This penetration of e-commerce websites with false information ,makes them vulnerable,hence we've developed
a system that proposes to  remove the vulnerabilities of the sites by classifying the fake and real information
to signify the the truthfullness of these e-commerce websites  and allow customer to have the better understanding
of the services or product with the genuine and real reviews, and prevent them from indulging in any scam.
<br />
In India, cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method, accumulating 75% of the e-retail activities.
Demand for international consumer products (including long-tail items) is growing faster than in-country supply
from authorised distributors and e-commerce offerings.Hence it is essential to maintain the truthfullness of 
these retail sites in order to customer have the satisfaction with the genuinity of the products.
